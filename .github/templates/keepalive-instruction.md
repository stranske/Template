Your objective is to satisfy the **Acceptance Criteria** by completing each **Task** within the defined **Scope**.

**This round you MUST:**
1. Implement actual code or test changes that advance at least one incomplete task toward acceptance.
2. Commit meaningful source code (.py, .yml, .js, etc.)—not just status/docs updates.
3. Mark a task checkbox complete ONLY after verifying the implementation works.
4. **POST A REPLY COMMENT** with completed checkboxes using the **EXACT TEXT** from the lists below.

**CRITICAL - Checkbox Format:**
When posting your reply, copy the **exact checkbox text** from the Tasks and Acceptance Criteria sections below. Do NOT paraphrase or summarize. The automation matches text exactly.

Example format for your reply:
```
## Completed this round

### Tasks
- [x] Implement core functionality
- [x] Add unit tests

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All tests pass
```

**DO NOT:**
- Commit only status files, markdown summaries, or documentation when tasks require code.
- Re-post checklists without making implementation progress.
- Close the round without source-code changes when acceptance criteria require them.
- Paraphrase or shorten checkbox text—copy it exactly for tracking to work.

Review the Scope/Tasks/Acceptance below, identify the next incomplete task that requires code, implement it, then **post a reply comment** with the completed items using their **exact original text**.
